# Email Service Logging Enhancement Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive logging added to the email sending implementation in the `home` project.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/crates/libmom/src/impls/email.rs`
Enhanced the `EmailService` struct with detailed logging:

- **Initialization logging**: 
  - Logs SMTP host and port configuration
  - Logs sender information (from name and email)
  - Success/failure status of email service initialization

- **Email sending logging**:
  - Info log when preparing to send login code
  - Debug log showing the login code being sent
  - Trace logs for email subject and body length
  - Detailed SMTP operation timing (duration of send operation)
  - Success logs with duration information
  - Error logs with detailed error information
  - Debug logs for SMTP response details

### 2. `/crates/libmom/src/impls/endpoints/tenant/email_login.rs`
Enhanced both email login endpoints with comprehensive logging:

#### `generate_login_code` endpoint:
- Info log for incoming requests with email and tenant
- Warning logs for invalid email formats
- Debug logs for:
  - Email validation status
  - Generated login attempt IDs
  - Creation and expiration timestamps
  - Database operations (with row count affected)
- Info/error logs for email sending status
- Development mode logging for local testing

#### `validate_login_code` endpoint:
- Info log for validation requests
- Debug logs for IP address and user agent
- Database lookup logging with error details
- Expiration check logging with time differences
- Stripe subscription lookup logging
- Auth bundle creation logging
- Success logging with auth expiration time

### 3. `/crates/libmom/src/impls.rs`
Enhanced email service initialization during server startup:
- Detailed configuration logging
- Success indicators with emoji (✅)
- Failure indicators with emoji (❌)
- Development mode detection and logging
- Clear warnings when email service is not available

## Log Levels Used

- **INFO**: Major operations and status updates
- **DEBUG**: Detailed operation information for troubleshooting
- **TRACE**: Very detailed information (email content, etc.)
- **WARN**: Non-critical issues and fallback behaviors
- **ERROR**: Critical failures with operation details

## Benefits

1. **Troubleshooting**: Easy to track email sending issues through the entire flow
2. **Monitoring**: Can track email send success rates and performance
3. **Development**: Clear indication when in development mode
4. **Security**: Sensitive information (passwords) not logged, but enough context for debugging
5. **Performance**: Timing information for SMTP operations

## Example Log Output

```
INFO  Email login request received for email: user@example.com (tenant: example-tenant)
DEBUG Email validation passed for: user@example.com
DEBUG Generated login attempt ID: email-login-1234567890
DEBUG Login code created at 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z and expires at 2024-01-15T10:45:00Z
DEBUG Storing login code in database for email: user@example.com
DEBUG Inserted 1 row(s) into email_login_codes table
INFO  Email service is configured, attempting to send login code
INFO  Preparing to send login code email to user@example.com for tenant example-tenant
DEBUG Login code: 123456 (expires in 15 minutes)
INFO  Sending email via SMTP...
INFO  Email sent successfully to user@example.com in 1.234s
INFO  Successfully sent login code to email: user@example.com
INFO  Login code generation completed for email: user@example.com (code expires at: 2024-01-15T10:45:00Z)
```

This comprehensive logging will help diagnose any issues with email delivery and provide valuable insights into the email authentication flow.
